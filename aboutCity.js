An example of the architecture of the time, the palace is a 7 story structure that is placed near the Holkar Chhatris. The structure has gained the attention of tourists due to its size and age. <br><br>The structure comprises two parts with one near the center of the city and the other in an older section. Both parts utilize Maratha architectural styles. The entrance itself is marked with a large wooden door, supported by iron studs. Inside the entryway, there is a courtyard that consists of a Maratha arched Ganesha hall and a number of balconies, windows, and corridors that link to galleried rooms.

However, following the Third Anglo-Maratha War and the subsequent collapse of the Maratha empire in 1818, the Holkars agreed to establish a protectorate on behalf of the East India Company in Indore. This diplomatic move established the Holkar dynasty, which ruled the Indore state until Indian Independence in 1948. <br><br> The Krishnapura Chhatri themselves were built in the mid 19th century to honor the deceased members of the Holkar dynasty. They are named for Krishna Bai Holkar, the wife of famed military leader Yashwantrao Holkar and the mother of Malhar Rao Holkar II.

The material was locally sourced; white sandstone from Seoni and red sandstone from Patan, both in Madhya Pradesh. Interestingly, leftover material from the incomplete Phooti Kothi, also in Indore, was used to construct this hall. The building was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales, George V, in 1905, and in those days, cost Rs 2,50,000 to build.<br><br>" +

The surrounding complex also features a children’s park, a temple and a library. The Hall’s high ceiling is remarkable, made of white plaster of paris and painstakingly adorned with gold, with palladian arches, a terraced roof and ornamental moldings adding to the grandeur of the building. However, perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the monument is its clock tower, at a height of ninety feet and capped by a large 15x15 feet dome housing the clock itself";

Vishnu and Brahma decide to travel along the pillar downwards and upwards respectively, to find the end of the light. Brahma lied that he had found the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity.

The temple was under the Chauhan Kings during the entire Mughal rule, without much renovation. In the 19th century, the temple was rebuilt by the Holkar rulers, chiefly Rani Ahalya Bai Holkar.
